      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

 - git-describe@4.0.4

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# git-describe

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/git-describe.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-describe)
[![npm license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/git-describe.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-describe)
[![travis build](https://travis-ci.org/tvdstaaij/node-git-describe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tvdstaaij/node-git-describe)
[![vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/npm/git-describe/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/npm/git-describe)

This Node.js module runs [`git describe`][1] on the working directory or any
other directory and parses the output to individual components. Additionally,
if your tags follow [semantic versioning][2] the semver will be parsed and
supplemented with the git-specific information as build metadata.

## Installation

Available from npm:
`npm install git-describe`

Tests are not included in the npm package — 
clone the git repository to run tests (Node.js 4+ required).

As of version 4.0.0, `semver` is an optional dependency that does not have to 
be installed if you do not require semver functionality.

Note that the `git` executable must be in the system's executable path for this module to function.

## Usage

The module exposes two functions: 

* `gitDescribe(directory, options, cb) -> Promise`
* `gitDescribeSync(directory, options) -> Object`

The only difference is that `gitDescribe` has an asynchronous API 
(either the callback argument or the returned promise can be used), whilst 
`gitDescribeSync` is fully synchronous 
(blocks until the git executable returns and throws an `Error` on failure).

Both functions can take a `directory` string (defaults to working directory)
and an `options` object. Either or both arguments can be omitted.

```javascript
const {gitDescribe, gitDescribeSync} = require('git-describe');

// Target working directory
const gitInfo = gitDescribeSync();

// Target the directory of the calling script
// Recommended when you want to target the repo your app resides in
const gitInfo = gitDescribeSync(__dirname);

// With options (see below)
const gitInfo = gitDescribeSync(__dirname, {
    longSemver: true,
    dirtySemver: false
});

// Another example: working directory, use 16 character commit hash abbreviation
const gitInfo = gitDescribeSync({
    customArguments: ['--abbrev=16']
});

// Asynchronous with promise
gitDescribe(__dirname)
    .then((gitInfo) => console.dir(gitInfo))
    .catch((err) => console.error(err));

// Asynchronous with node-style callback
gitDescribe(__dirname, (err, gitInfo) => {
    if (err)
        return console.error(err);
    console.dir(gitInfo);
});
```

## Example output

```javascript
{ 
    dirty: false,
    hash: 'g3c9c15b',
    distance: 6,
    tag: 'v2.1.0-beta',
    semver: SemVer, // SemVer instance, see https://github.com/npm/node-semver
    suffix: '6-g3c9c15b',
    raw: 'v2.1.0-beta-6-g3c9c15b',
    semverString: '2.1.0-beta+6.g3c9c15b'
}
```

## Options

Option             | Default     | Description
------------------ | ----------- | -----------
`dirtyMark`        | `'-dirty'`  | Dirty mark to use if repo state is dirty (see git describe's `--dirty`).
`dirtySemver`      | `true`      | Appends the dirty mark to `semverString` if repo state is dirty.
`longSemver`       | `false`     | Always adds commit distance and hash to `semverString` (similar to git describe's `--long`).
`requireAnnotated` | `false`     | Uses `--tags` if false, so that simple git tags are allowed.
`match`            | `'v[0-9]*'` | Uses `--match` to filter tag names. By default only tags resembling a version number are considered.
`customArguments`  | `[]`        | Array of additional arguments to pass to `git describe`. Not all arguments are useful and some may even break the library, but things like `--abbrev` and `--candidates` should be safe to add.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - google-protobuf@3.13.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

Protocol Buffers - Google's data interchange format
===================================================

[![Build status](https://storage.googleapis.com/protobuf-kokoro-results/status-badge/linux-javascript.png)](https://fusion.corp.google.com/projectanalysis/current/KOKORO/prod:protobuf%2Fgithub%2Fmaster%2Fubuntu%2Fjavascript%2Fcontinuous) [![Build status](https://storage.googleapis.com/protobuf-kokoro-results/status-badge/macos-javascript.png)](https://fusion.corp.google.com/projectanalysis/current/KOKORO/prod:protobuf%2Fgithub%2Fmaster%2Fmacos%2Fjavascript%2Fcontinuous)

Copyright 2008 Google Inc.

This directory contains the JavaScript Protocol Buffers runtime library.

The library is currently compatible with:

1. CommonJS-style imports (eg. `var protos = require('my-protos');`)
2. Closure-style imports (eg. `goog.require('my.package.MyProto');`)

Support for ES6-style imports is not implemented yet.  Browsers can
be supported by using Browserify, webpack, Closure Compiler, etc. to
resolve imports at compile time.

To use Protocol Buffers with JavaScript, you need two main components:

1. The protobuf runtime library.  You can install this with
   `npm install google-protobuf`, or use the files in this directory.
    If npm is not being used, as of 3.3.0, the files needed are located in binary subdirectory;
    arith.js, constants.js, decoder.js, encoder.js, map.js, message.js, reader.js, utils.js, writer.js
2. The Protocol Compiler `protoc`.  This translates `.proto` files
   into `.js` files.  The compiler is not currently available via
   npm, but you can download a pre-built binary
   [on GitHub](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)
   (look for the `protoc-*.zip` files under **Downloads**).


Setup
=====

First, obtain the Protocol Compiler.  The easiest way is to download
a pre-built binary from [https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

If you want, you can compile `protoc` from source instead.  To do this
follow the instructions in [the top-level
README](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md).

Once you have `protoc` compiled, you can run the tests by typing:

    $ cd js
    $ npm install
    $ npm test

    # If your protoc is somewhere else than ../src/protoc, instead do this.
    # But make sure your protoc is the same version as this (or compatible)!
    $ PROTOC=/usr/local/bin/protoc npm test

This will run two separate copies of the tests: one that uses
Closure Compiler style imports and one that uses CommonJS imports.
You can see all the CommonJS files in `commonjs_out/`.
If all of these tests pass, you know you have a working setup.


Using Protocol Buffers in your own project
==========================================

To use Protocol Buffers in your own project, you need to integrate
the Protocol Compiler into your build system.  The details are a
little different depending on whether you are using Closure imports
or CommonJS imports:

Closure Imports
---------------

If you want to use Closure imports, your build should run a command
like this:

    $ protoc --js_out=library=myproto_libs,binary:. messages.proto base.proto

For Closure imports, `protoc` will generate a single output file
(`myproto_libs.js` in this example).  The generated file will `goog.provide()`
all of the types defined in your .proto files.  For example, for the unit
tests the generated files contain many `goog.provide` statements like:

    goog.provide('proto.google.protobuf.DescriptorProto');
    goog.provide('proto.google.protobuf.DescriptorProto.ExtensionRange');
    goog.provide('proto.google.protobuf.DescriptorProto.ReservedRange');
    goog.provide('proto.google.protobuf.EnumDescriptorProto');
    goog.provide('proto.google.protobuf.EnumOptions');

The generated code will also `goog.require()` many types in the core library,
and they will require many types in the Google Closure library.  So make sure
that your `goog.provide()` / `goog.require()` setup can find all of your
generated code, the core library `.js` files in this directory, and the
Google Closure library itself.

Once you've done this, you should be able to import your types with
statements like:

    goog.require('proto.my.package.MyMessage');

    var message = proto.my.package.MyMessage();

If unfamiliar with Closure or it's compiler, consider reviewing Closure documentation
https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/tutorial
https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/closurebuilder
https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/depswriter
At a high level, closurebuilder.py can walk dependencies, and compile your code, and all dependencies for Protobuf into a single .js file.  Using depsbuilder.py to generate a dependency file can also be considered for non-production dev environments.

CommonJS imports
----------------

If you want to use CommonJS imports, your build should run a command
like this:

    $ protoc --js_out=import_style=commonjs,binary:. messages.proto base.proto

For CommonJS imports, `protoc` will spit out one file per input file
(so `messages_pb.js` and `base_pb.js` in this example).  The generated
code will depend on the core runtime, which should be in a file called
`google-protobuf.js`.  If you are installing from `npm`, this file should
already be built and available.  If you are running from GitHub, you need
to build it first by running:

    $ gulp dist

Once you've done this, you should be able to import your types with
statements like:

    var messages = require('./messages_pb');

    var message = new messages.MyMessage();

The `--js_out` flag
-------------------

The syntax of the `--js_out` flag is:

    --js_out=[OPTIONS:]output_dir

Where `OPTIONS` are separated by commas.  Options are either `opt=val` or
just `opt` (for options that don't take a value).  The available options
are specified and documented in the `GeneratorOptions` struct in
[src/google/protobuf/compiler/js/js_generator.h](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/compiler/js/js_generator.h#L53).

Some examples:

- `--js_out=library=myprotos_lib.js,binary:.`: this contains the options
  `library=myprotos.lib.js` and `binary` and outputs to the current directory.
  The `import_style` option is left to the default, which is `closure`.
- `--js_out=import_style=commonjs,binary:protos`: this contains the options
  `import_style=commonjs` and `binary` and outputs to the directory `protos`.
  `import_style=commonjs_strict` doesn't expose the output on the global scope.

API
===

The API is not well-documented yet.  Here is a quick example to give you an
idea of how the library generally works:

    var message = new MyMessage();

    message.setName("John Doe");
    message.setAge(25);
    message.setPhoneNumbers(["800-555-1212", "800-555-0000"]);

    // Serializes to a UInt8Array.
    var bytes = message.serializeBinary();

    var message2 = MyMessage.deserializeBinary(bytes);

For more examples, see the tests.  You can also look at the generated code
to see what methods are defined for your generated messages.

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - pixlise@0.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# PIXLISE

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.1.

## Setting up & running

Make sure you have the git submodules inited - pixlise now contains data-formats as a submodule. Once you have done a git clone of the pixlise repository, you will need to run:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Next, log your docker client into to registry.gitlab.com: `docker login registry.gitlab.com` and use the username/password you use to access gitlab

Now you can use our build-container (with all tools pre-installed) to run `genproto.sh` to generate the protobuf serialization code (from repo root):

`docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/pixlise -w /usr/src/pixlise registry.gitlab.com/pixlise/build-container:golang-1.14.1-protoc-3.6.1-protobuf-3.11.4-angular-8.1.1 /bin/bash genproto.sh`

Now to run it with the angular dev server:
`cd client`
`ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Auth0 Setup
The Auth0 account used is ok with mostly all defaults, but it does need a few specific configuration changes:
- Add the permissions the app needs. For a list of these, search for any code using AuthenticationService class's getIdTokenClaims$() function
- Add a "rule" to validate scopes, with the following code:
```
function (user, context, callback) {
  var permissions = user.permissions || ['some:thing'];
  var requestedScopes = context.request.body.scope || context.request.query.scope;
  var filteredScopes = requestedScopes.split(' ').filter( function(x) {
    return x.indexOf(':') < 0;
  });

  var allScopes = filteredScopes.concat(permissions);
  context.accessToken.scope = allScopes.join(' ');
  
  context.accessToken['https://namespace/customclaim'] = permissions;

  callback(null, user, context);
}
```
- Add a "rule" to return permissions in the id token, with the following code:
```
// https://community.auth0.com/t/accessing-the-permissions-array-in-the-access-token/27559/10
function (user, context, callback) {
  let namespace = 'https://pixlise.qut.edu.au/auth'; // configuration.NAMESPACE
  var map = require('array-map');
  var ManagementClient = require('auth0@2.17.0').ManagementClient;
  var management = new ManagementClient({
    token: auth0.accessToken,
    domain: auth0.domain
  });

  var params = { id: user.user_id, page: 0, per_page: 50, include_totals: true };
  management.getUserPermissions(params, function (err, permissions) {
    if (err) {
      // Handle error.
      console.log('err: ', err);
      callback(err);
    } else {
      var permissionsArr = map(permissions.permissions, function (permission) {
        return permission.permission_name;
      });
      context.idToken[namespace] = {
        permissions: permissionsArr
      };
    }
    callback(null, user, context);
  });
}
```
- Add a back-end API with the Audience: `pixlise-backend`

Make sure the environment.ts file used for building this Angular project has values that point it to the right Auth0 domain and PIXLISE backend endpoints.

## Auto-loading datasets for development

`environments.ts` has an autoload flag - set to true, and it will auto-load a dataset if you are signed in and your browser is pointed to `localhost:4200/home`. To see what dataset it loads, check `routes/home/home.component.ts`.

As part of this, there are some Autoload\*.json files in `/datasets/` which are uploaded as sessions by `/converter/upload.sh` so there is a consistant session to reload.

## Build/deploy

Run `deploy.sh` to run tests, up version, deploy to AWS

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Verbose build output

When shit hits the fan, this can turn on lots of build output for diagnosis:
`ng build --prod --named-chunks --verbose --build-optimizer=false --source-map >> buildoutput.txt`

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
    exercising permissions granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
