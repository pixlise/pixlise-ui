Removed this for now, as v3 UI worked vastly differently. v4 quant table can cater for what's needed so maybe it's ok to let users do this manually... In v3
this used to replace the panel under the context image with a special quant compare table. V4 UI flexibility doesn't even afford us a way to show this.
