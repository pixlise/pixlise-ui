                <h3>Searching for life on <span class="red">the Red Planet.</span></h3>
                <p>PIXLISE streamlines the search for life on Mars by helping scientists understand data from PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry) on NASA's Perseverance Rover. Designed for the flagship Mars 2020 mission, PIXLISE provides astrobiologists flexible and powerful visual analytics tools to quickly analyze and understand high-density, spatially-localized, imaging and XRF spectroscopy data.</p>
                <p class="pad-bottom">In 2018, PIXLISE was born out of Data to Discovery incubation program for science analysis tools, grew as part of JPL's Data Science Program, and elaborated into a robust tool through a multi-year partnership between Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.</p>

            <p>Although PIXLISE's story began on the Red Planet, it continues to unfold on our home planet. After years of close collaboration with scientists, engineers, and designers at multiple research institutions, we realized PIXLISE can do much more than its original mission. We are developing a multi-level deployment process which will bring PIXLISE's sophisticated visualization and analysis capability to scientists in geology labs across the globe.</p>
