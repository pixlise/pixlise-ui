          <p>If you don’t need cloud services, or your lab is unable to get them for your team, don’t worry! PIXLISE can run directly on your local laptop or PC.</p>
          <p>
            You’ll need to pull the source code from <a [href]="repoURL">our open source git repository</a>. You can build and launch the application directly from
            the source code, or run it in a Docker container, if you are familiar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Running locally, you will not have access to cloud parallelization for PIQUANT, or the any of the sharing features. However you will have all of the
            PIXLISE visualization and analysis suite.

        <div *ngIf="getActiveItem == getOptions[1]">
          <p>
            Set up a cloud account (we use AWS) and you can have a version of PIXLISE for your entire lab to share! All of the PIXLISE features will be enabled, and
            your lab will have its own website for shared access.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will need to set up your cloud account, run Kubernetes, and deploy PIXLISE as a Helm Chart. This is a non-trivial task, documentation and open source
            infrastructure code are on the way from the PIXLISE team, and we will release them soon."
