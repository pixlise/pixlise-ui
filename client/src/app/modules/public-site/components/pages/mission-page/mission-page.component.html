                <h3>Searching for life on <span class="red">the Red Planet.</span></h3>
                <p>PIXLISE streamlines the search for life on Mars by helping scientists understand data from PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry) on NASA's Perseverance Rover. Designed for the flagship Mars 2020 mission, PIXLISE provides astrobiologists flexible and powerful visual analytics tools to quickly analyze and understand high-density, spatially-localized, imaging and XRF spectroscopy data.</p>
                <p class="pad-bottom">In 2018, PIXLISE was born out of Data to Discovery incubation program for science analysis tools, grew as part of JPL's Data Science Program, and elaborated into a robust tool through a multi-year partnership between Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.</p>

            <p>Although PIXLISE's story began on the Red Planet, it continues to unfold on our home planet. After years of close-partnership collaboration with scientists, engineers, and designers across the globe, we realized PIXLISE can do much more than its original mission.
