        <span class="yellow">PIQUANT</span>* is an ultra-fast quantification engine that yields accurate quantification of thousands of scan
        points in minutes. Craft compound quantifications with different element sets or matrix assumptions for multiple regions of a single
        dataset. Rapidly visualize fully quantified maps of every element in your quantification. And don’t forget to share them all with your
        lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its origin in 2000, the PIQUANT database continues to be improved for planetary science missions. PIQUANT is fundamental parameters
        based and is uniquely optimized for cloud-parallelization enabling scientific investigation that is simultaneously fast and accurate.
        PIQUANT is also fully open-source, providing full transparency into the quantification process.
