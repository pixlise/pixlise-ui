          Deeply-integrated push-button sharing allows <strong>real-time collaborative analysis</strong> and multi-scientist, cross-disciplinary
          workflows across a single sample. Share discrete selections, custom expressions, quantification element sets, workspaces, and
          collections. Every scientist in your lab will have access to PIXLISE through the web, allowing your whole team to participate in
          analyzing shared objects.
